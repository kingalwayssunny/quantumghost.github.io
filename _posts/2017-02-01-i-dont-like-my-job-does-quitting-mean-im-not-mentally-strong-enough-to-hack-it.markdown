>Every week, at least one person asks me what quitting their job says about their mental strength. Many people worry that quitting a job they don't like serves as tangible evidence they lack mental muscle.

每周都至少有一个人问我，辞职对他们的精神力量意味着什么。很多人担心辞掉不喜欢的工作会成为自己缺乏意志力的有力证据。

>While one person will say, "I feel like I should be mentally strong enough to deal with my job instead of quitting," others insist, "I just don't have the mental strength to last another day."

当一个人说，“我感觉自己意志力足够强可以干好工作，而不是退出”，其他人会坚持认为，“我实在没有意志再工作一天”。

>But every once in a while, I hear from someone who perceives quitting as a sign of strength.

但偶尔我也会听说有的人会把辞职当做有意志力的表现。

Just the other day, I received an email that read, "I finally found the mental strength to quit my job. I'd been miserable for years but I didn't have the courage to leave."

某一天，我收到一份电子邮件讲到，“我最终找到精神力量辞掉我的工作了。我痛苦了很多年，但是我始终没有勇气离开“。

>So which is it? Does quitting a job you don't like mean you're mentally strong? Or, is real strength found in the ability to thrive in a tough work environment? Well, it depends on your attitude.

所以到底哪个是对的？辞掉你不喜欢的工作意味着你很有意志力吗？或者，真正的意志力存在于在令人痛苦的环境中坚持工作的能力中吗？当然，这取决于你的态度。

## The Environment Plays a Role in Your Mental Strength
## 环境会影响你的精神力量

>If you wanted to be physically strong, working in a gym would likely inspire you to build muscle. Being surrounded by people lifting weights all day, may motivate you to get fitter. And if the gym offered access to personal trainers and opportunities to use the equipment whenever you wanted, you'd probably find it easy to build muscle.

如果你想强身健体，在健身馆工作可以激励你健身增肌。被很多健身达人整天包围着，会鼓励你重塑体形。如果健身馆提供私人教练和随时使用器材的允诺，你肯定很容易练成一身肌肉。

>If, however, you worked 14 hour days in an office setting, it would be tougher to get buff. It'd be especially tough if the workplace cafeteria only served junk food and the boss expected you to do hours of work from home each night. The workaholic mentality would lead to fewer opportunities to lift weights and you'd probably find it much harder to get physically strong in that environment, compared to a job working in a gym.

然而如果你一天14小时在办公室格子里，就很难有这种精神鼓舞。尤其是工作场所的自助餐厅只提供垃圾食品，老板希望你晚上回家还在工作。工作狂的这种精神状态会导致健身的机会减少，在这种环境中你会发现健身变得很难。

>Well, mental strength is much like physical strength. The environment plays a huge role in your ability to build mental muscle.

精神力量和肉体力量很相像。环境对你提高自己的精神力量有很大的作用。

>Working in an unhealthy environment will drain your mental strength. Studies show working for a toxic boss increases the likelihood that you'll grow clinically depressed. And if you're surrounded by rude co-workers, research shows their behavior will wreak havoc on your productivity.

工作在不健康的环境会削弱你的精神力量。研究表明给无良老板工作会增加你得抑郁症的几率。如果你周围都是粗鲁的同事，他们的行为会严重破坏你的工作效率。

>So it's important to consider, does the job you have now support your efforts to build mental strength? Or, does the workplace--and the people in it--make it much more difficult to be your best?

所以需要细细思索，你现在的工作会支撑你提高精神力量的努力吗？或者，工作场所和同事会阻止你达到好的精神状态呢？

##Remind Yourself Quitting Is a Choice
##提醒自己辞职是一个选择

>If you quit your job with the mentality that you couldn't hack it, you'll struggle to reach your greatest potential. You might take a new job that's beneath your skills either because you think it's all you deserve or because you hope to find some success to boost your confidence.

如果你带着自己无法胜任的想法辞掉工作，那么你是在阻止自己发掘自己的潜力。你可能会找到一份自己可以轻松胜任的新工作，因为你认为自己就应该干这种工作，或者因为你希望通过成功来增强自信。

>If you really feel you can't stand your job, prove to yourself that you could stand if you wanted to. Work one day longer than you think can, and you'll see that you're able to tolerate feeling uncomfortable more than you give yourself credit for.

如果你真的认为自己无法胜任你的工作，先证明给自己只要你想，你是可以胜任的。延长某一天的工作时间直到比你想象自己能承受的更长，你会发现你可以容忍的不舒适比许诺自己的更多。

>Just make sure you aren't working to prove something to someone else. Thinking, "I'll show my boss I was cut out for this," is about acting tough, not being strong. When you walk away knowing, "I could do hack this job if I wanted, but I don't want to," you'll reassure yourself you're still strong.

确信你不是为了证明给其他人而工作。想象“我会给老板说我不干了”，这种想法显得很痛苦，而不是很坚定。当你离开的时候才知道，“如果我想我是可以胜任这份工作的，但我不想干了”，你会使自己更确信自己很坚定。

>There's a lot of power in saying, "I'm quitting my job because it doesn't suit my needs," as opposed to thinking, "I can't stand to be here for one more second." Acknowledge your choices and step away in a manner that will empower you to become better.

“我辞掉工作是因为它不匹配我的诉求”，这种想法很有力量，远胜于认为“我无法再在这儿多坚持一秒钟”。承认自己的选择并且离开，在一定程度上让自己变得更好。

## Quit to Better Your Life
## 离开去更好的生活

>If you are committed to building the best life you can, quitting may open the door to a better opportunity. Whether you seek more flexibility in your schedule or you want a more positive work environment, stepping into a healthier situation could promote your growth.

如果你承诺自己要更好的生活，辞职会让你得到更好的机会。不管你想要自己日程更有弹性，还是你想要更积极向上的工作环境，迈入更健康的环境会更有利于你的成长。

>A new position may also be more in line with your values. A job that pays less money but allows for more time with your family, for example, may give you a better sense of meaning and purpose. And a sense of purpose is key to being mentally strong.

一个新的职位当然也可能会更匹配你的个人价值。薪水少一点但是让你有更多时间陪伴家人，像这样的工作可能会让你感觉到更有意义和目标。有目标的感觉是意志力强大的关键。

## Turn Quitting Into an Opportunity to Build Mental Strength
## 将辞职变成增强精神力量的机会

>Staying in a job you hate may say more about your mental strength than quitting does. Is your self-worth dependent on how much money you make? Are you afraid of change? Have you convinced yourself you can't possibly be successful doing something else?

从事你厌恶的工作会对你的精神力量影响很大，多过辞职。你的个人价值建立在你赚钱多少之上吗？你害怕改变吗？还是你说服自己做别的事情你不可能成功？

>Of course, some people have practical reasons for sticking it out. Feeding a family or paying off a huge burden of debt may be the payoff. And sometimes, working a job you don't like for a short duration makes sense.

当然，有些人有自己坚持的实际原因。赡养家庭或者偿还债务可能是决定性的因素。有的时候，短时间做一份你不喜欢的工作也有意义。

>Quitting every job because you think the grass is greener on the other side also won't make you mentally strong. There's no such thing as a perfect job and working hard to overcome workplace challenges could help you build muscle.

因为这山望着那山高而辞职不会增强你的意志力。没有其他东西除了一份完美的职位并且努力工作克服职场挑战可以让你增强意志力。

>But, don't be fool yourself into thinking that quitting a job you hate means you're weak. Although many internet memes will tell you that you should never quit, mentally strong people know when to walk away. They recognize when a situation isn't productive and they're willing to move on.

但是，不要愚蠢的认为辞掉你不喜欢的工作意味着自己很弱。虽然很多网络段子告诉你不应该辞职，精神强大的人知道什么时候该离开。他们当环境不再让你有收获的时候，就是你应该离开继续出发的时刻。
